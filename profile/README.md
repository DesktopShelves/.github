## ‚ú® Elevator Pitch

If your Mac desktop is a blizzard of screenshots, drafts, ZIPs, and ‚Äúfinal_v7_really_final‚Äù files, **DesktopShelves** turns chaos into **neat, named shelves** that sit directly on the desktop. Each shelf groups related files, shows live thumbnails, supports quick actions, and remembers where everything belongs‚Äîso your workspace looks intentional, not overwhelming.

## ‚ùì What is DesktopShelves? (Very detailed)

**DesktopShelves** is a **visual organizer** that overlays your macOS desktop with **smart shelves**‚Äîlightweight containers that hold files by project, topic, or time window. Instead of pushing you into a new app, DesktopShelves **augments the space you already use**. Drop a file on a shelf and it‚Äôs immediately categorized; drag between shelves to re-file; sort with a click; rename inline. Think of it as **Finder‚Äôs missing layer**: fast, tactile, and always visible.

At a technical level, every shelf is a **real macOS folder** rendered as a compact, scrollable strip with **live previews** (images, PDFs, audio scrubbing where supported), **badges** (file type, sync status), and **context actions** (open, reveal in Finder, share, tag, rename). You can anchor shelves to screen edges, stack them, auto-hide them behind other windows, or pin favorites above everything for a heads-up ‚Äúcommand bar.‚Äù Shelves remember **layout density** (big thumbnails for design assets, compact list for logs), **sort order** (date added for inboxes, kind for research), and **color themes** per project so you can scan visually without reading.

DesktopShelves isn‚Äôt just a pretty face on folders; it **reduces friction at capture time**. New screenshots can auto-land in a **‚ÄúToday‚Äù** shelf; downloads tagged with ‚Äúinvoice‚Äù can jump to **Finance**; files matching patterns (e.g., `*.sketch`, `brief*.pdf`) can be routed into the right shelf the moment they appear. You can define **rules** (by name, tag, extension, size, date) per shelf, creating a light automation system that keeps your desktop tidy even on busy days.

Because context switching kills focus, DesktopShelves favors **inline actions**. Quick-look a PDF, rename a file, tag it, or move it‚Äîwithout opening Finder. Need to clear the decks for a meeting? **Snooze** noisy shelves to a side panel, or collapse them to minimal headers you can expand later. When a project wraps, archive the shelf to a ZIP or move the backed-up folder to an external drive while keeping a **ghost shelf** as a breadcrumb.

File safety matters. Shelves operate on **real files in real folders**, so there‚Äôs no lock-in, database risk, or proprietary container. You can open the same folders in Finder, sync them via iCloud/Dropbox/Git, or share them with teammates. DesktopShelves simply gives you a **faster, more human-friendly view** of the same content, with optional rules to keep it flowing.

In short, DesktopShelves reframes the desktop from a dumping ground into a **living, glanceable dashboard** for your active work: capture, triage, progress, and archive‚Äîwithout changing how macOS stores files.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About DesktopShelves (Deep dive, extended)

**Design philosophy.** Traditional launchers hide your files; full DAM tools over-structure them. DesktopShelves finds the middle: **light structure + instant access**. A shelf is quick to create, easy to name, and trivial to delete. You‚Äôre rewarded for small decisions (‚Äúthis belongs to Design/Client A‚Äù) rather than punished by heavy metadata forms.

**Layout & presence.** Shelves are **first-class citizens** of the desktop. They can float over wallpaper, tuck under windows, or ‚Äúpeek‚Äù with a slim header that expands on hover. Snap to grids, align to gutters, and reserve ‚Äúlanes‚Äù for work vs. reference. The **density slider** lets you switch from moodboard-style thumbnails to precise, developer-friendly lists with monospaced names.

**Capture flows.** Create dedicated **Inbox** shelves‚Äîe.g., *Today, This Week, Downloads-Triage*. Screenshots can auto-name with timestamps and drop into *Today*. Drag from Mail, Safari, or design tools directly onto a shelf; rules can add tags or rename on arrival. You can also **paste** items (images from clipboard) straight into a shelf as files.

**Rules & automation.** Light rules deliver outsized calm: ‚ÄúIf name contains invoice ‚Üí Finance,‚Äù ‚ÄúIf extension is .sketch/.fig ‚Üí Design,‚Äù ‚ÄúIf older than 14 days ‚Üí move to Archive.‚Äù Rules run **silently** or with a **tray notification**; each shelf can preview what would have matched to avoid surprises. For safety, any rule can be **undoable** with a built-in change log.

**Focus & flow.** Use **Scene Modes**: *Deep Work* hides chatter shelves and enlarges your active project; *Present* collapses everything to headers; *Review* sorts by date so you can sweep the week. Scenes can be **hotkeyed** so your desktop adapts to the moment.

**Collaboration & portability.** Because shelves map to folders, sharing is natural: right-click ‚Üí *Reveal in Finder* ‚Üí attach or share a link if it‚Äôs on a synced drive. The **shelf manifest** (a tiny JSON) stores layout and rules so teammates can clone the same view without copying files.

**Respect for macOS.** DesktopShelves leans on **Quick Look**, **Tags**, **ColorSync**, and **Accessibility**. It inherits system-level previews, honors Finder tags, supports dark mode, and exposes VoiceOver labels for every control. No custom file format, no fragile database‚Äî**future-proof by design**.
